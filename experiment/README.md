# What is this?

This folder contains scripts and input data that served as experiments to
better understand the Tezos node machinery.

Especially regarding big maps the Tezos node is a bit of a black box, these
experiments helped gain insight into what big map operation sequences can be
expected.

# How to run the experiments?

Simply call `./script/run`. This will remove output dir and a new output dir will result from the `run` execution.
